# MBAI-GDB
Welcome to the documentation of **Money Ball AI Graph DataBase**, the specialized backend architecture designed for advanced basketball analytics. 

With the goal of understanding at best the data coming from the highly interconnected nature of sports, MBAI-GDB proposes an experimental approach at modelling basketball, in particular the *NBA*, as a complex **heterogeneous temporal graph**, with a very precise hierarchy that enables deep traversal of relationships between *teams*, *players*, *games*, *seasons* and *play-by-play events*. 

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding the project's architecture, data fetching mechanisms, and the core components that drive its functionality.
